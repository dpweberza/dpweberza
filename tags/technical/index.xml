      <description>Preamble In an effort to contribute more to my blog and help jog my memory, I have decided to start a series of blogs detailing some popular design patterns and how I have used them.
Chain of Responsiblilty The Chain of Responsibility pattern is defined as follows: &amp;ldquo;Gives more than one object an opportunity to handle a request by linking receiving objects together&amp;rdquo; - Gang of Four book on Design Patterns</description>

      <description>The other day I was building our new orders interface in VueJS and I came across a performance problem on large orders where we were creating a large number of Hibernate objects in one request. For 750 objects the request was taking around 2 minutes. This was certainly unacceptable as the whole reason I was building a new orders interface was to scale better and provide a better UX.
So I started looking at options to do a batch insert instead, unfortunately we are stuck on Hibernate 2 at the moment due to a rather large code base that cannot be easily upgraded.</description>
